## Reflection

  - I used [Express](https://expressjs.com/) configuation to have a minimalistic approach
  - I used serverside rendering to keep it simple, using an isomorphic approach would speed up user experience  
  - Husky precommit hook will help consistency in styling and comments
  - the project makes use of the following project/tools :
      - [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
      - [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
      - [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
      - [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest)
      - [jest](https://jestjs.io/)
      - [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
      - [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)
