## Reflection

  - I used Express basic configuation to have a minimalistic approach
  - I used serverside rendering also thinking about SEO
  - Husky precommit hook will help consistency in styling and comments
  - the project makes use of the following project/tools :
      - [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
      - [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
      - for css [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
