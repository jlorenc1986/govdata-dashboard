## Reflection

  - I want a to build on top of showdown a editor with more user friendly features
  - The basic implementation is for desktop only 
  - the project makes use of the following project/tools :
      - [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
      - [react](https://react.dev/)
      - [showdown](https://showdownjs.com/)
      - [react testing library](https://testing-library.com/)
      - [playwright](https://https://playwright.dev/)
      - [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
      - [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
      - for css I started with no framework in mind, but [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a good candidate when more features will come in.
